<h3>What Portion of Water Bodies in Colorado Interact with Oil/Gas Fields?</h3>
<h4>This map describes the difference between water bodies in Colorado and Oil/Gas Fields across the state. I included a buffer of 100m from the water bodies to express the possibility of flooding. The intersection of the oil/gas fields with the water bodies is imortant to understand so that cross-contamination can be prevented. The contaimination of rivers and lakes with not only oil/gas but the drilling processes can be harmful to the wildlife and humans nearby. It is important to express the differences between the water and fields so that humans can be careful when interacting with the water in these areas but also downstream as well. Additionally, with this information, humans can be more careful drilling for oil/gas along the water bodies.</h3>
